# Kilo - Text Editor Project
##### This text editor is a project made in C to demonstrate the practice that I have put into learning the language.
##### The project demonstrates how low level programming is used to manipulate the working of the terminal.
##### The code enters the raw mode in the terminal itself to help read and write to files like a text editor.
##### Everything from scrolling in every direction to moving before and after evey line (to the previous or the next line) has been rendered by the code.
##### The representation of each key press has been rendered while keeping in mind that '\x1b' represents the escape character.
##### Ability to save a new file whenever the code is run or to edit an existing file is also made available.
##### Search functionalities have been implemented such as to press Control+F to find any word and then use arrow keys to find the next or previous matches if present.
##### Syntax highlighting has been done for '.c', '.c++', '.h' files while making sure that does not happen with normal text files.
